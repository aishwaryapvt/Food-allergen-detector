# Food Allergen Detector using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based web application that identifies potential allergens from food ingredient lists. Built using PyTorch, FastAPI, and scikit-learn, this project uses a TextCNN model to analyze text and predict the presence of common allergens such as milk, egg, gluten, soy, peanuts, shellfish, and tree nuts.

---

## Features

- Detects allergens from ingredient text using trained TextCNN model
- Real-time prediction API built with FastAPI
- Offline dataset support (Open Food Facts processed data)
- Model trained on cleaned and preprocessed food ingredient data
- Simple REST API endpoint for integration in web or mobile apps

## Installation & Setup

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aishwaryapvt/Food-allergen-detector.git
cd Food-allergen-detector
```

### Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
# or
source venv/bin/activate   # (Mac/Linux)
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the model training (if needed)
```bash
python src/models/train_textcnn.py
```

### Launch the FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn src.models.api_fast:app --reload
```

## Example API Request

### POST `/predict`

**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "ingredients": "wheat flour, milk solids, egg, sugar"
}
```

**Response:**
```json

    "confidence_scores": {
      "egg": 0.82,
      "gluten": 0.75,
      "milk": 0.90,
      "peanuts": 0.03,
      "shellfish": 0.01,
      "soy": 0.22,
      "tree nuts": 0.08
    }
  }
}
```

## Model Overview

The TextCNN model uses convolutional layers over word embeddings to extract local features from ingredient text. It is trained as a multi-label classifier to predict probabilities for multiple allergens simultaneously.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate frontend for user-friendly interaction
- Expand allergen categories using larger datasets
- Deploy model to cloud platforms (e.g., Render, Hugging Face Spaces)
